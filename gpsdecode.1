.SH "NAME"
gpsdecode \- decode RTCM or AIVDM streams into a readable format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBgpsdecode\fR\ 'u
\fBgpsdecode\fR [\-c] [\-d] [\-e] [\-j] [\-u] [\-D\ \fIdebuglevel\fR] [\-V]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is a decoder/encoder for various binary packet formats associated with GPS and differential\-correction services\&. It produces a text dump on standard output from binary on standard input, or binary packets on standard output from text on standard input, and aims to be 100% information\-preserving in both directions\&. As well as data, the decoder also prints decoder status messages to standard error as necessary\&.
.PP
Two of the supported formats are RTCM 2 and 3, a pair of obscure and complicated serial protocol used for broadcasting pseudorange corrections from differential\-GPS reference stations\&. You can use this mode of the tool with
\fBnc\fR(1)
to examine RTCM feeds from DGPSIP servers or Ntrip broadcasters\&. The decoder dump formats for RTCM2 are described in
\fBrtcm\fR(5); these lines go to standard output\&.
.PP
Another supported format is AIVDM\&. This is the sentence format used by the marine Automatic Identification System\&. This can be decoded, but not yet encoded\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fB\-d\fR
option tells the program to decode packets presented on standard input to a text dump on standard output\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.PP
RTCM2 will be dumped in one of the formats of
\fBrtcm-104\fR(5)
on standard output\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-e\fR
option option tells the program to encode a text dump in one of the formats of
\fBrtcm-104\fR(5)
to standard output\&. This option is a placeholder: support for RTCM2 encoding from the Sager format has been removed
.PP
The
\fB\-u\fR
suppresses scaling of AIS data to float quantities and text expansion of numeric codes\&. A dump with this option is lossless\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-j\fR
sets the dump format to JSON, with each each field preceded by a quoted label and colon and the entire dump line wrapped in curly braces\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
sets the AIS dump format to separate fields with an ASCII pipe symbol\&. Fields are dumped in the order they occur in the AIS packet\&. Numerics are not scaled\&. Strings are unpacked from six\-bit to full ASCII
.PP
The
\fB\-V\fR
option directs the program to emit its version number, then exit\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-D\fR
option sets a debug verbosity level\&. It is mainly of interest to developers\&.
.SH "AIS DUMP FORMATS"
.PP
Without the
\fB\-j\fR
option, dump lines are values of AIS payload fields, pipe\-separated, in the order that they occur in the payload\&. Spans of fields expressing a date are emitted as an ISO8601 timestamp (look for colons and the trailing Z indicating Zulu/UTC time), and the 19\-bit group of TDMA status fields found at the end of message types 1\-4 are are dumped as a single unsigned integer (in hex preceded by "0x")\&. Unused regional\-authority fields are also dumped (in hex preceded by "0x")\&. Variable\-length binary fields are dumped as an integer bit length, followed by a colon, followed by a hex dump\&.
.PP
By default, certain scaling and conversion operations are performed for the output\&. Latitudes and longitudes are scaled to decimal degrees rather than the native AIS unit of 1/10000th of a minute of arc\&. Ship (but not air) speeds are scaled to knots rather than tenth\-of\-knot units\&. Navigation status and positioning\-system type are dumped as text strings rather than IAS numeric codes\&. Rate of turn may appear as "nan" if is unavailable, or as one of the strings "fastright" or "fastleft" if it is out of the IAS encoding range; otherwise it is quadratically mapped back to the turn sensor number in degrees per minute\&. Vessel draughts are converted to decimal meters rather than native AIS decimeters\&.
.PP
With the
\fB\-j\fR
option, the AIS dump format changes to JSON\&. Data fields are handled as described above in scaled and unscaled modes, but are values attached to JSON attributes as described in
\m[blue]\fBAIVDM/AIVDO protocol decoding\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "APPLICABLE STANDARDS"
.PP
The applicable standard for V2 is
RTCM Recommended Standards for Differential NAVSTAR GPS Service
RTCM Paper 194\-93/SC 104\-STD\&.
.PP
Note that
gpsdecode
presently recognizes only the 2\&.1 level of RTCM; the protocol was revised up to a version 2\&.3 including additional messages relating to GLONASS and real\-time kinematics before being deprecated in favor of V3\&. It is now semi\-obsolete\&.
.PP
The applicable standard for V3 is
RTCM Standard 10403\&.1 for Differential GNSS Services \- Version 3
RTCM Paper 177\-2006\-SC104\-STD\&.
.PP
Ordering instructions for the RTCM standards are accessible from the website of the
\m[blue]\fBRadio Technical Commission for Maritime Services\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
under "Publications"\&.
.PP
The applicable standard for AIVDM is
ITU\-R M\&.1371: ITU Recommendation on the Technical Characteristics for a Universal Shipborne Automatic Identification System (AIS) using Time Division Multiple Access in the Maritime Mobile Band, A more accessible description can be found at
\m[blue]\fBAIVDM/AIVDO protocol decoding\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
on the references page of the GPSD project website\&.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.PP
AIDVM decoding of types 16\-17, 22\-23, and 25\-26 is unverified\&.
.PP
RTCM3 decoding is buggy and incomplete\&.
.PP
RTCM2 represents floating\-point quantities as an integer multiple of a fixed scale factor\&. Editing an RTCM2 dump can produce numbers that are not an integer multiple of the scale factor for their field\&. If you do this, the value actually packed into binary RTCM2 will be rounded down to the nearest scale unit, and dumping will show slightly different numbers than those you entered\&. This bug could be fixed by supporting the
\fB\-u\fR
option to suppress scaling\&.
.PP
The RTCM2 decoder logic is sufficiently convoluted to confuse some compiler optimizers, notably in GCC 3\&.x at \-O2, into generating bad code\&.
.PP
Older version of this utility used comma as a field separator with the
\fB\-c\fR
option\&. This was a mistake, as ship name and other string fields can contain commas\&.
